Javascript for Other Developers
===============================
This is book is intended to help developers familiar with other languages ( or students familiar with basic programming) learn Javascript. The topics might range from very basic to advanced. 

### Why another book
I have experience of tutoring around 1000 students in Javascript and Java. I want to consolidate all that experience into a book with surplus examples and **optional** detailed explanation provided for the extra curious minds or those needed more help. 

### What if I am wrong 
There is always scope for better example or better explanation or sometimes correct the content here. Any such constructive criticism is welcome and will be rightly acknowledged.

I shall validate the content and approve the pull request, the build is automated so it gets reflected immediately (and automatically).
